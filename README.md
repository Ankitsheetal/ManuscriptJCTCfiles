This repository contains the structures and simulation parameters for polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene-block-polyethylene glycol (PE/PE-b-PEG) polymer melts, as well as their composites with tetramethylammonium montmorillonite clay. These resources are suitable for both all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) simulations.

For the composite systems, we provide two distinct clay morphologies embedded in the polymer matrix:

Exfoliated clay assemblies

Tactoid (stacked) clay assemblies

Each system includes both the initial configurations and the final configurations obtained after extensive simulations.
